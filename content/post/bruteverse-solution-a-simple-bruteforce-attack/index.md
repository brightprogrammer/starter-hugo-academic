T﻿his is also another easy crackme. I don't know why is it rated 4.0 in difficulty. It should be like 2 or less than that. All you have to do is read the assembly of the program or decompiled code (if available) and everything will be clear. When I opened this in IDA first I saw that this only had one simple function. I was confused that a 4.0 rated challenge and only this function? Maybe something advanced was going on. So I objdumped it and found nothing more than what was already shown in IDA.

T﻿his is using basic syscalls to write to stdout. I thought this was a patching challenge because if you scroll down the disassembly, you'll see that it can print a string if we somehow jump to it, magically. So I tried patching this binary. You can see that in the given image I'm jumping to l2 instead of l1. This printed out some jibberish string.

B﻿ut we don't have anything else in the binary, other than this data.

Now either this program is stupid or it wants to do something else. So as a last try, I thought of bruteforcing. The binary itself gives us hint on how we can bruteforce it. We need to xor the whole string with a single key. I created a script for this : 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

data = [0x0BB,0x96,0x81,0x96,
        0x0D3,0x9A,0x80,0x0D3,
        0x8A,0x9C,0x86,0x81,
        0x0D3,0x95,0x9F,0x92,
        0x94,0x0D3,0x0C9,0x0D3,
        0x0A1,0x0C1,0x0A5,0x0C1,
        0x0A1,0x0C6,0x0BA,0x0BD,
        0x0C6,0x0AC,0x0C7,0x0A0,
        0x0AC,0x0A1,0x0C7,0x0C1,
        0x0BF,0x0BF,0x0C4,0x0AC,
        0x0B5,0x0C1,0x0BD]

for k in range(1, 0xffff):
    msg = ''.join(chr(data[i] ^ k) for i in range(len(data)))
    if msg.isascii():
        print(hex(k), msg)

```

R﻿unning this prints a whole lot of strings, but there's one string that makes some real sense and that must be the flag!

C﻿an you find that string in the image? I don't know if this is really the correct way to solve this or not. I tried contacting the author but at the time of writing this solution, no reply came. But we have something! better than nothing :-)

M﻿eet you next time in some other solution!
