So, I started to gain interest in pwn challenges when I saw one of my team-mate (**4n0nym4u5**) solving a pwn challenge from [pwnable.tw](https://pwnable.tw/). I didn't understand a bit but there was this urge in me trying to understand what he was doing. I was able to deduce this much : 

* He is writing an exploit in python
* He is continuously using GDB-GEF for that
* He was re-running his exploit again and again, maybe to debug it.
* It was awesome!

So, the next day I tried searching on how to start binary exploitation and I found almost nothing that helped me (maybe I was impatient or something but I really didn't find it). I thought maybe trying to solve a real challenge help me learn so I downloaded the **start** challenge from [pwnable.tw](https://pwnable.tw/). That didn't help either. I tried reading writeups about it but that didn't help either mainly because by conscience wasn't allowing it because maybe by reading the solution I'll destroy my chance of learning it.
