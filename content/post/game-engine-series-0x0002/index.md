This post will be on introduction to Vulkan API. We will try to get an idea of how Vulkan Loader works, look at some common definitions and some other interesting things! So, let's begin by asking what is Vulkan?

### What is Vulkan ?

Vulkan is a fast, new and modern 3D graphics programming API. The initial release was about 5 years ago and it is now used my many games and game engines. The API was initially made by AMD for modern GPUs and was initially named Mantle which was later made open source, renamed to Vulkan and is now maintained by the **Khronos Group**. It is written purely in C and supports many platforms like : [Android](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=Android&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3MCqvKEkvX8TK7piXUpSfmQIAyAsAJhgAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoAXoECEIQAw), [Linux](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=Linux&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLUz9U3SCuoqipYxMrqk5lXWgEATgerNhUAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoAnoECEIQBA), [Fuchsia](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=Fuchsia&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLVT9c3NEw2zEnLKKoqXsTK7laanFGcmQgAxklZLRsAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoA3oECEIQBQ), [BSD Unix](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=BSD+Unix&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLQz9U3MEwzzVnEyuEU7KIQmpdZAQDAUa93FwAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoBHoECEIQBg), [QNX](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=QNX&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLQz9U3yEhKSlnEyhzoFwEA4JwBWRIAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoBXoECEIQBw), [Windows](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=Windows&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLQz9U3MCmKt1jEyh6emZeSX14MAFTjqsQWAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoBnoECEIQCA), [Nintendo Switch](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=Nintendo+Switch&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLVT9c3NEw2K7FMMzPMWcTK75eZV5Kal5KvEFyeWZKcAQB0QcE-IwAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoB3oECEIQCQ), [Stadia](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=Stadia&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLVT9c3NEzLMs8oyUiPX8TKFlySmJKZCACloW6EGgAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoCHoECEIQCg), [Tizen](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=Tizen&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3yDDPqchKWcTKGpJZlZoHADhg-LkWAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoCXoECEIQCw), [macOS](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=macOS&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLQz9U3MDWtLFrEypqbmOwfDADb5b_yFAAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoCnoECEIQDA), [IOS](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=IOS&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3MC5PyjE0WcTK7OkfDAC-b2NaFAAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoC3oECEIQDQ), [Raspberry Pi](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=AOaemvJ0adMSWlfVR9scr93Ko9YiffsEIA:1631340626919&q=Raspberry+Pi&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLSz9U3SM9NNzZLX8TKE5RYXJCUWlRUqRCQCQA5myHgHQAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwijnsy0ofbyAhXymeYKHYs3CygQmxMoDHoECEIQDg).

### But why is it called an API?

Well, this is because it is an API. Vulkan API is a set of rules (functions with defined valid usage and invalid usage etc..) defined in the [vkspec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html) which hardware vendors follow, more like make an implementation out of it to make their device driver. This driver contains functions with same names and arguments as defined in [vkspec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html) and these functions, no matter how they are implemented in the inside must look and work in the same way as defined by the [vkspec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html). The whole purpose of this API is to hide the actual implemetation from the user. This way no matter how the hardware vendors implement their device driver, we can use it as long as it follows the API rules. The functions defined in the device driver can be used to interact with GPU or any other device that can do some processing using the device driver provided by the hardware vendor. In simple words, Vulkan API is the header (.hpp) of a class and the `ICD` is the definition(.cpp) of that class and you are using this class in your application. So, you see Vulkan is combination of both the specification and the implementation (`ICD`) which makes the Vulkan API. First the API is decided, then a specification (vkspec) and implementation (drivers) is made for that version of API.

### Can't we just directly talk to GPU?

Short answer : **Not always**

Long answer : You cannot (you can in some cases like Intel and AMD), because that'd mean the GPU vendor revelaing their secrets to you. Each graphic card manufacturer try to make their product faster than their competetors and in that pursuit they research a lot and make their own methods to do stuffs faster and those methods are to be kept confidential. That is why we have a graphics driver. It is a platform and graphics card dependent library which contains the functions that [Vulkan Spec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html) defines and we link to that library to interact with the GPU.

To get an idea of how Intel driver works see the [Anvil source code](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/tree/main/src/intel/vulkan) and [RADV source code](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/tree/main/src/amd/vulkan) for AMD.

### But, how exactly do we talk to GPU?

As stated above, we link our program with the graphics driver in order to make it talk to GPU. But wouldn't that mean that we have to have graphics driver for every vendor our there? No, you don't need to do that! This is where the interface comes in. Since, Vulkan is an interface between our program and GPU, as long as both the hardware vendor and the developer follow the rules defined by Vulkan API to use it's interface, then they don't need to care about each other. You can just assume that the system that your program will run in will already have the graphics drivers in place and then we can just link to it dynamically at runtime because ofcourse static linking will not be possible here. After we load the `ICD` at runtime, we do a sybmol lookup and fill up our function symbols with pointers to the actual functions in memory.

### How exactly will I link to driver dynamically?

You use the [Vulkan Loader](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader) developed by the Khronos Group. As mentioned earlier, the Loader will search for available `ICD`s present on host machine and will try to load them by using library functions like [`dlopen`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html) on Linux or [`LoadLibraryA`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) on Windows. You can link to this loader either dynamically at runtime(like what volk does) or the usual way that we will follow because by default libraries are linked dynamically or we statically link the loader with our program. For help with the former method, refer to the following resources (if you want to make your own loader instead of using [volk](https://github.com/zeux/volk) or [Vulkan Loader](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader)) : 

* For Linux or other Unix based systems : <https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/dl-libraries.html>
* For Windows : <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/using-run-time-dynamic-linking>
* Intel tutorial on how to do it for vulkan : <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/api-without-secrets-introduction-to-vulkan-part-1.html>

For the latter method, we just have to download [Vulkan Loader](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader) and link to it statically or dynamically however you like. This is the method I will choose. There is a small performance gain if you use a custom loader instead, I, however at this moment just want to see something on my screen ASAP.

Volk (and similar implementations) gets it's perfomance boost because it skips the [trampoline](http://kylehalladay.com/blog/2020/11/13/Hooking-By-Example.html) (also known as hooking) part in Vulkan Loader. An example image retrieved from khronos site is :

![Webinar Recap: Vulkan Loader Deep Dive](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/blogs/2017-Webinar-Recap-Vulkan-Loader-Deep-Dive.jpg)Here is a paragraph from a [vulkan.lunarg.com post](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.2.170.0/windows/loader_and_layer_interface.html) :

>
> Applications are not required to link directly to the loader library, instead they can use the appropriate platform-specific dynamic symbol lookup on the loader library to initialize the application's own dispatch table. This allows an application to fail gracefully if the loader cannot be found. It also provides the fastest mechanism for the application to call Vulkan functions. An application will only need to query (via system calls such as `dlsym`) the address of `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` from the loader library. Using `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` the application can then discover the address of all functions and extensions available, such as `vkCreateInstance`, `vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties` and `vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties` in a platform-independent way.
>
> ##### Best Application Performance Setup

> If you desire the best performance possible, you should set up your own dispatch table so that all your Instance functions are queried using `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` and all your Device functions are queried using `vkGetDeviceProcAddr`.

So notice that when no layers are enabled, you'll be directly talking to the `ICD`.

### How does the loader work?

The main task of loader is to search for the graphics driver, also called `Installable Client Driver` (`ICD`) and then get pointers to all or some functions from the library file after loading it into memory. List of installed `ICD`s can be found in a `json` file that is stored in a specific place during Vulkan SDK installation. In Linux you can usually find this `json` file in `/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d`.

Say you are calling some function named `doSomething(xyz)`. Now, this function has to be defined somewhere otherwise your program will show a `segfault` or some other linking error. When a loader links with your program, it contains the symbols of all or some Vulkan functions. When your program will execute, the loader will search for a valid `ICD` on your system (eg : `/usr/lib/libvulkan_intel.so.` in linux for intel integrated graphics) . Once, a valid `ICD` is found, the loader loads it using the system libraries like `dl` on linux. It loads the file in the memory and then gets the memory address of functions using their names. Once we have the address, these addresses are stored in those symbols defined by the loader earlier. This way when you call the function `doSomething(xyz)`, your request is first recieved by the loader and then redirected to the `ICD`, or more precisely the graphics driver that the hardware vendor developed for you to talk to their hardware.

This way the loader allows you to use multiple `ICD`s at a time! You just need to have the driver and the `ICD` present on your system. Below is an image to show how loader works

![High Level View of Loader](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/raw/master/loader/images/high_level_loader.png)source : Khronos Group

In Linux you will generally find the loader as a shared object file named `/usr/lib/libvulkan.so`. You will see a library file named the same in our projects `/lib` directory because remember we build this as a dependency.

### Vulkan Validation Layers

Validation layers are helper libraries that intercept your application's communication with the GPU (Vulkan Physical Device or [`VkPhysicalDevice`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDevice.html)). They help you in detecting bugs and errors in your program for easy debugging. They are an optional feature and hence can be removed anytime. This plugin type behaviour helps when you are deploying your game. In the debug builds, you can enable them to look for errors and in the release builds you can turn them off. This way, there won't be any error checking in release builds of your game and it will run faster as compared to the debug builds. In APIs like OpenGL, error checking is done all the time which adds an extra performance drop in the application. Layers sometimes also modify your function calls just in order to make them work.In the above image, you can see the connection between loader and the layer is a two way communication channel.

When you ask Vulkan to get all layers present on system, it will look for a manifest file which provides the names and versions of layers that are present on the system. The location of this manifest file is provided in the environment variables of your system. It is generally located in `/usr/share/vulkan/explicit_layers.d`.

### Vulkan Extensions

Vulkan extensions augment the Vulkan API by providing more platform specific or device specific feature. For example : Vulkan does not provide a direct way to display rendered images onto the screen. For this there is a Vulkan extension for creating a display surface for the window created by application. This extension is named `VK_KHR_surface`. This extension can be used to display rendered images onto the window we create. This extension is used in combination with a platform specific extension for surface creation. There is an extension named `VK_KHR_swapchain` to create a swapchain for us. A swapchain is used to replace image currenly presented on screen with a newly rendered one.

You can see the list of all vulkan instance and extensions on your system by executing `vulkaninfo --summary`

### Vulkan Instance ([`VkInstance`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkInstance.html))

A Vulkan instance represents our communication state with Vulkan. In OpenGL, the system is initialized for all application and all applications communicate with same instance of OpenGL but here in Vulkan, all applications talk to Vulkan in a different manner so they each need to have their own Vulkan Instance. This instance stores our application information and defines how we are going to use Vulkan. Below is a statement from vkspec

> There is no global state in Vulkan and all per-application state is stored in a [`VkInstance`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkInstance.html) object. Creating a [`VkInstance`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkInstance.html) object initializes the Vulkan library and allows the application to pass information about itself to the implementation.

When we will create a [`VkInstance`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkInstance.html), we will request instance level extensions and layers to be enabled. The loader will forward our calls or enabled layers and extensions when needed.

This [`VkInstance`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkInstance.html) is actually a pointer to a data structure defined somewhere in the driver code. Here is an example how Anvil implements a Vulkan instance : 

```cpp
#include "vk_instance.h"

struct anv_instance {
    struct vk_instance                          vk;

    bool                                        physical_devices_enumerated;
    struct list_head                            physical_devices;

    bool                                        pipeline_cache_enabled;

    struct driOptionCache                       dri_options;
    struct driOptionCache                       available_dri_options;
};
```

What you will be able to use in your code is only a pointer to this data structure and some functions to manipulate this struct. You are only restricted to using the API and not this code.

Here is how RADV for AMD implements it : 

```cpp
#include "vk_instance.h"

struct radv_instance {
   struct vk_instance vk;

   VkAllocationCallbacks alloc;

   uint64_t debug_flags;
   uint64_t perftest_flags;

   bool physical_devices_enumerated;
   struct list_head physical_devices;

   struct driOptionCache dri_options;
   struct driOptionCache available_dri_options;

   /**
    * Workarounds for game bugs.
    */
   bool enable_mrt_output_nan_fixup;
   bool disable_tc_compat_htile_in_general;
   bool disable_shrink_image_store;
   bool absolute_depth_bias;
   bool report_apu_as_dgpu;
};
```

Notice the change in definition of instance when the device changes. Definiton of `vk_instance` can be found in `mesa/src/vulkan/util` to be  : 

```cpp
// in vk_objects.h
struct vk_object_base {
   VK_LOADER_DATA _loader_data;
   VkObjectType type;

   struct vk_device *device;

   /* For VK_EXT_private_data */
   struct util_sparse_array private_data;
};

// in vk_instance.h
struct vk_instance {
   struct vk_object_base base;
   VkAllocationCallbacks alloc;

   struct vk_app_info app_info;
   struct vk_instance_extension_table enabled_extensions;

   struct vk_instance_dispatch_table dispatch_table;

   /* VK_EXT_debug_report debug callbacks */
   struct {
      mtx_t callbacks_mutex;
      struct list_head callbacks;
   } debug_report;
};
```

There is a `struct` named [loader_instance](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/blob/e1dc222803390e8e18e4a9a211609341ea34ccab/loader/loader_common.h#L230) in the [Vulkan Loader](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader) too but that is only a wrapper around these actual implementations.

```cpp
// Per instance structure
struct loader_instance {
    struct loader_instance_dispatch_table *disp;  // must be first entry in structure

    // Vulkan API version the app is intending to use.
    uint16_t app_api_major_version;
    uint16_t app_api_minor_version;

`VkInstance` is actually a typedef to `VkInstance_T*` as you will see here : 

```
// link : https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers/blob/4fee3efc189c83ccd26a9cd8265185c98458c94d/include/vulkan/vulkan_core.h#L25
#define VK_DEFINE_HANDLE(object) typedef struct object##_T* object;

// link : https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers/blob/4fee3efc189c83ccd26a9cd8265185c98458c94d/include/vulkan/vulkan_core.h#L100
VK_DEFINE_HANDLE(VkInstance)
```

### Vulkan Physical Device (`VkPhysicalDevice`)

A Physical Device represents any Vulkan compatible device connected to your system. By Vulkan compatible, I mean that there is an `ICD` present for it on your system. Since your GPU has a device driver that conforms to the Vulkan API, it's Vulkan compatible. If the loader detects an `ICD` present on your system, it'll create a struct that wraps the actual physical device struct in the `ICD` and return it's pointer to us. We can then use this to talk to our GPU in future. Below is an example from RADV to show how it is implemented in the driver : 

```cpp
struct radv_physical_device {
   struct vk_physical_device vk;

   /* Link in radv_instance::physical_devices */
   struct list_head link;

   struct radv_instance *instance;

   struct radeon_winsys *ws;
   struct radeon_info rad_info;
   char name[VK_MAX_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_NAME_SIZE];
   uint8_t driver_uuid[VK_UUID_SIZE];
   uint8_t device_uuid[VK_UUID_SIZE];
   uint8_t cache_uuid[VK_UUID_SIZE];

   int local_fd;
   int master_fd;
   struct wsi_device wsi_device;

   bool out_of_order_rast_allowed;

   /* Whether DCC should be enabled for MSAA textures. */
   bool dcc_msaa_allowed;

   /* Whether to enable NGG. */
   bool use_ngg;

   /* Whether to enable NGG streamout. */
   bool use_ngg_streamout;

   /* Number of threads per wave. */

### Vulkan Logical Device ([`VkDevice`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkDevice.html))

A logical device is exactly what it's name represents. It is not a real device like [`VkPhysicalDevice`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDevice.html). We define what features we want to use from the physical device and create a logical device from it. This logical device will contain the state of our interaction with the GPU we are using. This also means that we can have multiple logical devices for the same physical device, each one using either same or different features of the physical device. This way you can actually select the best physical device out of all the available ones and use it for heavy tasks and use a less performant one for smaller tasks. 

Here is Anvil's implementation of `VkDevice` :

```cpp
// defined in anv_private.h

### Dispatchable and Non-Dispatchable Objects

First understand what dispatch table means by reading [this](https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/function-dispatch-tables/) blog. Then [take a look at what vulkan spec says](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#fundamentals-objectmodel-overview). After this read the following : 

From an application's point of view, a `dispatchable` handle is just an opaque handle to an underlying struct in the device driver. A non `dispatchable` handle is a `uint64_t` on `x86-64` platforms (major difference on `x86` platforms) but from the loader's point of view, a `dispatchable` handle contains a pointer to a dispatch table full of function pointers. When you make a `dispatchable` handle, for e.g. the `VkInstance` the loader will first create a  `loader_instance` (wrapper for Vulkan instance at loader level) and then will forward this call to all `ICD`s present on the system, then create the implementation level instance (eg : `anv_instance`, `radv_instance`), store their pointer and then will use it to get all instance related functions from the `ICD`s. The loader will then search for next `ICD` on the system and then do the same with that `ICD` too. If you take a good look at the loader level Vulkan instance wrapper, you will find that it is forming a linked list of all instances from various `ICD`s. If you make a logical device, then the loader will spawn a logical device for you and will get the respective functions from the `ICD`s in same way it was done for the instance. 

A `non-dispatchable` handle is just an opaque handle and it is never used to retrieve function pointers.

> The devices, queues, and other entities in Vulkan are represented by Vulkan objects. At the API level, all objects are referred to by handles. There are two classes of handles, dispatchable and non-dispatchable. *Dispatchable* handle types are a pointer to an opaque type. This pointer **may** be used by layers as part of intercepting API commands, and thus each API command takes a dispatchable type as its first parameter. Each object of a dispatchable type **must** have a unique handle value during its lifetime.

above para is from [vkspec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#fundamentals-objectmodel-overview).

Below is a part of code from `vulkan_core.h` header file.

    #else
        #define VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(object) typedef uint64_t object;
    #endif
#endif

VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkDescriptorPool)
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkFramebuffer)
VK_DEFINE_NON_DISPATCHABLE_HANDLE(VkCommandPool)
```

Clearly from above code, [`VkInstance`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkInstance.html), [`VkDevice`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkDevice.html), [`VkPhysicalDevice`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDevice.html), [`VkQueue`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkQueue.html) and [`VkCommandBuffer`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkCommandBuffer.html) are `dispatchable` handles. So these all will be used to get dispatch tables to get function pointers. You will also see structures named dispatch table in the instance, physical device, logical device structure provided above.

So, this is it for this post. There is much more to learn in the Vulkan API. This is all what will need in the next few posts. I will explain other left out things when needed. 

Note that I'm just providing you these code snippets in order to get an idea of what is being done on the inside. You mustn't think that this is how all hardware vendors do it. When I started learning Vulkan, I just had this itching sensation to know what exactly is this instance or physical device represent in code? You can easily skip these code snippets as we won't be using them anywhere but understanding this won't harm you. Instead this will help you when you read some low level implementation code like this. The main purpose of me providing you these internal definitions is because you might not understand every concept right now and in future you might need to refer to this and when you do that, you'll have a more better understanding. Infact you must consider reading some previous blogs if you don't understand a concept. If you understand the inner workings then the API will be quite easy to learn. Ofcourse you won't be needing these internal implementations but it just helps (you will see).

See you in next post ;-)
