In this post we will setup our project directory for development. There is no *hard and fast rule* for project directory structure and this one will be based on my past experiences. We will be using the following things (for now) : 

* [Vulkan Graphics API](https://www.vulkan.org/)
* [SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)](https://www.libsdl.org)
* C++ Compiler (Clang or GCC)
* [CMake Build System](https://cmake.org/)
