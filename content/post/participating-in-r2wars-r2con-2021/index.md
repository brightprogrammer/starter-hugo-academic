So I participated in this year's online [r2con](https://rada.re/con/2021/)'s [r2wars](https://rada.re/con/2021/#r2wars) event. It was amazing. Me and my friend (**[X3eRo0](https://twitter.com/X3eRo0)**) participated in this years [r2con](https://rada.re/con/2021/). I never heard of this event before and it was introduced to me by **[X3eRo0](https://twitter.com/X3eRo0)** himself. Also this type of event was completely new to me.

### Beginning

My exams were already over and I was sitting waiting for a nice thing to happen in my life  (working on my side projects). As I've mentioned in my earlier post ([Solving **X3eRo0**'s CrackME The Hard Way](https://brightprogrammer.netlify.app/post/solving-x3ero0s-crackme-the-hard-way/)) **[X3eRo0](https://twitter.com/X3eRo0)** challeged me to solve his CrackMe and he'll invite me to his **[ctf-team](https://medium.com/zh3r0)**. This acted as a motivation to me. At the time of writing this post, the CrackMe is still unsolved (I am still at reversing stage, the read time is 109mins and I guess it will probably increase to 400mins+ after I'm done with it). After a month approx he sent me an invitation to join his **[ctf-team](https://medium.com/zh3r0)** (probably by seeing how foolish I am and that I won't be able to complete his crackme in an eternity ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¤£). Everyone is polite and helpful I feel comfortable in the team ðŸ˜„.

So, I was there checking my notifications, reading some ctf writeups, waiting for a nice team event to occur and on the 2nd day of joining the team, **[X3eRo0](https://twitter.com/X3eRo0)** invited me and some other team members to participate in this event. Some members we busy with their college life and other stuffs so in the end only me and **[X3eRo0](https://twitter.com/X3eRo0)** were participating.

### What is [r2wars](https://rada.re/con/2021/#r2wars)?

At the time of joining, I didn't even knew what we have to do there. I just jumped in because of my excitement. I had this feeling that it will be amazing so let's just do whatever has to be done to get involved. 

[r2wars](https://rada.re/con/2021/#r2wars) is a game like [corewars](https://www.corewars.org/) in which participants write bots that fight in an arena and winner bots get some amazing prizes. Bots compete against each other in a round robinn tournament. The competing bots are assigned same memory space and the main goal of each bot is to crash the other or to survive till the other bot crashes on it's own.

[r2wars](https://rada.re/con/2021/#r2wars) is held once every year. It is a part of [r2con](https://rada.re/con/2021) which usually happened (before [covid19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19)) like a normal conference but since the last two years [it was held online](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=r2con).
