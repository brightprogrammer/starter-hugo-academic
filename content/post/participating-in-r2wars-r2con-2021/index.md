So I participated in this year's online r2con's r2wars event. It was amazing. Me and my friend ([X3eRo0](https://twitter.com/X3eRo0)) participated in this years r2con. I've never heard of this event before and it was introduced to me by [X3eRo0](https://twitter.com/X3eRo0) himself.

My exams were already over and I was sitting waiting for a nice thing to happen in my life  (working on my side projects).
