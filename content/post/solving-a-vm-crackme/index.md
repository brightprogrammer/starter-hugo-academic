I'm always having problems solving a VM obfucscation challenge in any CTF. This time I plan to end this by solving a VM CrackMe. I got this from a team-mate.

Here are a few resources before we begin : 

* [Analysis Of Virtualization-based Obfuscation](https://youtu.be/b6udPT79itk)
* [The challenge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yc54_ogPcVUpFICXVPOnFLsGvS8Xq668/view?usp=sharing)

As I mentioned earlier, I am not good with VM crackmes but when I started following that video (first), just 40 minutes into the video and I'm able to detect the dispatcher function. I highly recommend anyone who really wants to learn. I'll be solving a few VM crackmes to improve my skills.
