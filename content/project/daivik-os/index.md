# Daivik Operating System
Here is the [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/brightprogrammer/daivik)  
## Description :
This is a hobbyist OS written in C++. I made this operating system while I was learning how to make one. The project did not go that far because of my college entrace exam preparations. The OS is able to pring string as shown in the above image.

## Comments : 
I however have a better approach to make an OS now so I will try to make one again from scratch. I sort of lost hope to take it to GUI state because I this is not a unix like os and because of that graphics drivers for Vulkan, OpenGL etc won't run on it but now I know that you can create GUI too using assembly. For this the inspiration is many other hobbyist OS and the creator of DOOM's game engine John Carmack. That man is on another level. He wrote a graphics driver using pure assembly!!
