# Daivik Operating System
Here is the [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/brightprogrammer/daivik)  
## Description :
This is a hobbyist OS written in C++. I made this operating system while I was learning how to make one. The project did not go that far because of my college entrace exam preparations. The OS is able to pring string as shown in the above image.

## Learning : 
Daivik OS taught me how awesome an Operating System actually is! How an OS loads a program into memory and how it get’s executed. It taught me various security related stuffs too like there are various rings of security in the processor itself. How are drivers for graphics, keyboard, mouse etc… written. How a kernel is written. It also taught me how to setup my project in an efficient way. Did you know that malloc is actually provided by the operating system?

## Comments : 
I however have a better approach to make an OS now so I will try to make one again from scratch. I sort of lost hope to take it to GUI state because I this is not a unix like os and because of that graphics drivers for Vulkan, OpenGL etc won't run on it but now I know that you can create GUI too using assembly. For this the inspiration is many other hobbyist OS and the creator of DOOM's game engine John Carmack. That man is on another level. He wrote a graphics driver using pure assembly!!
