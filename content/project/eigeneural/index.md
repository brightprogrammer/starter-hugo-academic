# EigeNeural
Here is the [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/brightprogrammer/EigeNeural)
## Description
This was written for a contest in GeeksForGeeks during The Lockdown. Unfortunately I deleted my account there (a BIG mistake) but I have the code so I upload it here. It uses [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for it's linear algebra operations.

## Learning :
The very first version of EigeNeural taught me how to do object oriented programming. I started by watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK9AbJ4P8ao) tutorial. I still remember, I used to fail in Chemistry everytime and it was my Chemistry exam next day (for final exams of XIth class) and I didnâ€™t even knew the syllabus but still I watched this tutorial the whole day (yes whole day). In case youâ€™re worrying I passed the exam or not, yes I passed it somehow because of the stuffs I knew already also the teacher was not that strict

## Comments
The code might have some bugs in it. I'm posting this here as a project because I wrote the code without copying from anywhere. Machine Learning in C/C++ is still a challenge. At the time of writing I started learning Machine Learning & AI and in that pursuit I wrote this code. Also, you can use it anywhere you like because it's really fast and lightweight because I used one of the fast linear algebra libraries available out there for C++.     
PS : I made a new account in GFG and mailed them to claim the post back but sadly never got a reply ðŸ˜¦.
