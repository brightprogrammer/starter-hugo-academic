## Description :
This is a simple calculator program written in [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/). This was my attempt to learn how to do GUI programming using [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/). I made this simple calculator in order to learn how sizers work in [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/).
## Comments : 
I also made a text editor in [Qt](hhtps://www.qt.io) but I don't have the source/screenshot of it now. I plan to make my own GUI library/framework in future using Vulkan.
