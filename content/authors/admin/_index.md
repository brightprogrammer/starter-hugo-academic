Hi! I am Siddharth Mishra. I am a student and I love reading about low level problems in Computer Science. I have progressive experience of about 4 years in C++ and I would call myself an *intermediate*. I still have a lot to learn and I am curious to learn more and more. I love writing about my achievents and learnings, so this place is a journal of my journey. 

At the age of 17, I have made several attempts to write my own desktop applications ( a text editor / calculator / an IDE itself ), in making my own game engine ( 3-4 tries ) and I quit because of different reasons everytime. Those failures have taught me a lot and I am glad that I tried instead of giving up at the very start. I am still working on my game engine.

At the point of writing this post, I am not even in college. I am preparing for my entrace exams. I have a small list of private achievements and by private I mean less exposed because of ingorant people around me. So, to make myself recognized I will write about what I know on this blog.
