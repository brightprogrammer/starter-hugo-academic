I'm a student of **Integrated Masters Of Science, Mathematics** **& Computing** at [BIT Mesra](https://bitmesra.ac.in/). I'm currently in the pursuit of gaining knowledge in fields I'm interested in, like Machine Learning, Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis, Operating System Development, Compiler Design, Game Development, Game Engine Development, GUI Programming, Computer Vision and similar low level areas in Computer Science.

I like to work in constrained environments with as low resources as possible, because, necessity is the mother of invention. This is one of the major reasons I started to develop intersets in doing things the old way, the hard way but the fast way!
